Sic bo is a dice game played with three die.  It is very popular in Asia, the US and the UK.  
Players will pick the type of bet they will place, each of which has certain pay-out odds and winning conditions and then roll the dice.  
You will implement the following bet types: Big, Small (these two are the most common), Even, and Odd. 
You can find definitions for these under the previous link for Sic bo.  Please use the UK variant of odds to determine the payout.

Additional requirements:

    Starting Page
        The initial page should contain the form you fill out to place each wager. Explain the bets and and odds used.
        For each bet type, allow them to enter the value they are betting on.  
        They should be able to place multiple simultaneous bets. For example, bet even and odd (you'll note this doesn't make sense but let them do it anyway)
    Result Page
        The resulting page should display the results of the roll using images
        For each bet type, indicate how much they bet, if they won or lost that bet and display how much they won or lost.  For example, a person betting $1 on 1:1 odds would get $2.  Betting $2 on 1:1 would get $4.  Betting $1 on 30:1 odds gets them $31 and $2 gets them $62 and so on... Losing the bet means loosing the money!
        Show the aggregate bet amount, loss, winnings amounts.
        Allow them to return to the starting page easily so they can place another bet.
    The roll
        The roll should use random numbers, do not tamper with the random number to increase the odds of the house winning ;)
    Error Checking
        On the server check for sensible errors and display them, for example placing a bet for "a" dollars.
